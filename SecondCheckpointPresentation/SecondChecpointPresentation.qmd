## Predicting Offensive Play Calls in the NFL

* Successfully anticipating whether the offense will run or pass is critical to defensive success

. . . 

* In the NFL, winning often comes down to preparation and play-calling — where sideline strategy is just as important as on-field performance

. . . 

* Our goal is to build a model that predicts the likelihood of a run play based on pre-snap context — and then use that model to evaluate pass rushers through their ability to generate pressure in unexpected passing situations

## Data

* NFL play-by-play data (2016-2023):
  <ul> <li>Core situational features: down, distance, quarter, yardline, score differential, time remaining</li> <li>Formation information and team-specific 'logged run rate'</li> </ul>

. . .

* Player tracking data (Weeks 1-9, 2022):
  <ul> <li>Pre-snap motion indicators</li> <li>Formation compactness (density)</li> <li>Offensive line splits</li> </ul>
  
## Plan of Action

* Completed steps
  <ul>
      <li>Created basic and advanced models</li>
      <li>Evaluated pass rushers using first models</li>
      <li>Began to implement tracking data</li>
  </ul>

. . .

* Next steps

* Finalize model
  <ul> <li>Refine and validate tracking-based features</li> <li>Select the most predictive and interpretable variables</li> </ul>
  
. . .

* Apply Model to Pass Rusher Evaluation
  <ul> <li>Incorporate run defense metrics for a more complete picture</li> </ul>
