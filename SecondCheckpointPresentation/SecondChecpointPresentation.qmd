## Predicting Offensive Play Calls in the NFL

* Accurately anticipating a run or passing play is vital for defensive play-calling

. . . 

* The game is won through strategy, both on the field and the sidelines

. . . 

* Our goal is to build a model that predicts the likelihood of a run play given pre-snap context, then use that model to evaluate pass rushers

## Data

* NFL play-by-play data from 2016-2023 seasons
  <ul>
      <li>Down, distance, quarter, yardline, score differential, time left</li>
      <li>Formation, 'logged run rate'</li>
  </ul>

. . .

* Tracking data from first 9 weeks of 2022 season
  <ul>
      <li>Pre-snap motion, density of formation, lineman splits</li>
  </ul>
  
## Plan of Action

* Completed steps
  <ul>
      <li>Created basic and advanced models</li>
      <li>Evaluate pass rushers using first models</li>
      <li>Begin to implement tracking data</li>
  </ul>

. . .

* Next steps

* Finalize model
  <ul>
      <li>Polish tracking metrics</li>
      <li>Choose which variables should be used</li>
  </ul>
  
. . .

* Use final model to evaluate pass rushers
  <ul>
      <li>Also take into account run defense</li>
  </ul>
